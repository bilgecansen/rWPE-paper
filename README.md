**Scripts for using rWPE on simulated and empirical data (in review at MEE)**

All scripts use the functions in the scripts below:

**functions_pe.R**: Functions to calculate permutation entropy (PE) and weighted permutation entropy (WPE) and apply the rWPE test.

**functions_pop.R**: Functions to run Ricker population simulations.

**sc1_simulations.R**: Runs Ricker population simulations and apples rWPE.

**sc2_analyse_rogers.R**: Applies rWPE to test data published at Rogers et al. (2022) and plots the results.

**sc3_analyse_gpdd.R**: Applies rWPE to time series from Global Population Dynamics Database and plots the results.

**sc4_run_adpe_models.R**: Runs state-space models with Ad√©lie Penguin colony counts to estimate population abundance time series while accounting for observation error.

**sc5_run_empe_models.R**: Runs state-space models with Emperor Penguin colony counts to estimate population abundance time series while accounting for observation error.

**sc6_plots_simulations.R**: Plots rWPE test results from Ricker population simulations.

**sc7_plot_penguins.R**: Plots rWPE test results from penguin population time series.
